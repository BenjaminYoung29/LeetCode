## 题目

https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/submissions/

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```



## 题意

找出面积最大的长方形。暴力解法就遍历即可。长为j-i, 宽为Math.min(height[i], height[j])



## 我的代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int max=0;
        for(int i=0;i<height.length;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<height.length;j++){ 
                max=Math.max(max, (j-i)*Math.min(height[i],height[j]));
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

## 两端指针代码

两个指针分别从两端往中间移动，因为面积总是受高度低的那一端的限制，所以每次移动高度低的那一端。复杂度O(n)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int max=0;
        int p=0, q=height.length-1;
        while(p<=q-1){
            max=Math.max(max,(q-p)*Math.min(height[p],height[q]));
            if(height[p]>height[q])
                q--;
            else
                p++;
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```
