https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```



## 题意

给出n天的股价。只能交易一次，即买入1次，卖出1次。求最大利润是多少。不能先卖后买。



## 我的代码

暴力解法，简单遍历即可

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<prices.length;j++){
                if(prices[i]>prices[j])
                    continue;
                else{
                    max=Math.max(prices[j]-prices[i], max);
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

如果将每日股价画成折线图，则可以看出最大利润为最高股价-最低股价。且最高点要在最低点的右边。因此记录最低点，再记录最高利润即可。

```java
class Solution{
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices){
        int max=0;
        int min=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            if(prices[i]<min)
                min=prices[i];
            else if(prices[i]-min>max)
                max=prices[i]-min;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
