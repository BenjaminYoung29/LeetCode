## 题目

https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

## 题意

跟House Robber I 一样，只不过这是个回环，选了头就不能选尾。本来想着判断是否选了头来确定遍历的长度，觉得好难想。看了hint只要分成两种情况用两次循环就好了。一次是[0, n-2], 一次[1, n-1]



## 我的代码



```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length==0){
            return 0;
        }else if(nums.length==1){
            return nums[0];
        }else if(nums.length==2){
            return Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);   
        }else{
            int o=rob2(nums, 0, nums.length-1);
            int t=rob2(nums, 1, nums.length);
            return Math.max(o,t);
        }
    }
    private int rob2(int[] nums, int start, int end){
        int[] dp=new int[nums.length];
        dp[0]=nums[start];
        dp[1]=Math.max(nums[start], nums[start+1]);
        int j=2;
        for(int i=start+2;i<end;i++, j++){
            dp[j]=Math.max(dp[j-2]+nums[i], dp[j-1]);   
        }
        return dp[j-1];
    }
}
